Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical JavaScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).

- Our package manager is bun.

Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variables and functions.
- Use PascalCase for components.
- File names for components should be in PascalCase. Rest of the files in kebab-case.
- Prefix component names with their type (e.g. ButtonAccount.jsx and ButtonSignin.js, Card AnalyticsMain.jsx and CardAnalyticsData.jsx, etc.)
  Syntax and Formatting
- Use arrow functions
- Components should be exported arrow functions e.g: export const Function = (props: Props) => {...}, do not export default, accept for page.tsx which should be export default function Function(props: Props) {...}
- favor types over interfaces
- Do not write comments under any circumstances
